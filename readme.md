For our ambient display, we chose to visualize tide data from the coordinates closest to us (Rochester, NY) using the WorldTide API (worldtides.info). Powered by the servo, the gears turn according to the angle corresponding to the tide height (measured between 1 to -1). We accounted for the servo having a range of 0 to 180 degrees. 

When the tide is high the string is stretched out and wide. Alternatively, the string is condensed and flat when the tide is low. 

For this project, we were inspired by artists Soo-Hwa Yuan and Jennifer Townley. The weights in their work, paired with string or fabric, allows them to create intricate shapes. We used string because it is dynamic and has an interesting look when woven and pulled tightly.
